first thing first => bash is a text shell this translate the commands i pass to it and start another programs for me

It has two Modes --
                    --interactive Mode: when it give Me this prompit when opening the terminal [ $ ] waitting for enter command
                    --Non-interactive Mode: when it's executing command from file that has this commands sequentially this called [script]


////=> i can type  [this hashbang]         => #!/usr/bin/env bash  =>rather than
                                             #!/bin/bash

i can use it if i didn't know the path of the bash interpreter

[env] is the program that know all the programs paths
