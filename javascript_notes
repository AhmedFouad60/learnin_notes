Methods that deal with strings
    ____________________________________
1-String.substr(startpoint,numberOfCharacterToExtract)==>
this will return the specified string from the start to what you stop
--some cases=>
if the start is nagitive it will start with the end of string 
if the start is nagitive and is greater than the string length this will start from the first char in the string
if the start is positive and is greater than the string length this will return empty string 
---------------------------------------------
2- String.slice(startPoint,endPoint);
cut the string from the startpoint to endPoint not including the endpoint
it's cases is the same as substr() function
