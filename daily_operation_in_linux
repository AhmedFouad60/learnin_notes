How to access a usb flash drive from the terminal? (How can I mount a flash drive manually?)


1. Find what the drive is called

You'll need to know what the drive is called to mount it. To do that fire off:

sudo fdisk -l
You're looking for a partition that should look something like: /dev/sdb1. Remember what it's called.

2. Create a mount point

Create a new directory in /media so you can mount the drive onto the filesystem:

sudo  mkdir /media/usb
3. Mount!

sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/usb
When you're done, just fire off:

sudo umount /media/usb
